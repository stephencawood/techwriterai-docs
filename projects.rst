Projects
--------

Projects organize your Operations and settings and are the first place to start in the Tech Writer AI (TWAI) application.

.. note::
    Projects will eventually allow users to share their Operations with other users.

Creating a Project
==================

To create a Project, navigate to your Dashboard, and click the "Create Project" button. Once you've created a Project, it will appear on your dashboard.

Projects settings
=================

To open the Project settings, click the Settings gear icon in the vertical navigation on the left side of the screen.

Training files
++++++++++++++

From your Project settings page, you can upload a file to train the TWAI application on your own data. This is useful if you want to use the **Freeform question** operation to query your data.
