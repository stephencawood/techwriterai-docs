Welcome to the Tech Writer AI documentation. If you have any questions, please email us at `contact@techwriterai.com <mailto:contact@techwriterai.com>`_.

Tech Writer AI is a productivity application for anyone who works on documentation. This could be someone with the title of Technical Writer, but not necessarily. Many people work on documentation and all of us would like better tools--especially in the context of a docs-as-code publishing environment. Tech Writer AI aims to address the need for these tools.

Getting Started
===============

To get going with the Technical Writer AI (TWAI) application.

1. Create a Project and click on your new Project to open it.

1. Create an Operation from the Project page, and click on it to choose your Operation settings.

1. Once you have an Operation, you can specify which source you'd like to use and which actions you'd like to run on that data.

    Some actions have their own settings which allow you to specify your preferences for that action.

1. Remember to save your Operation so you can re-run your selected choices.
