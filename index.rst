Getting Started
===============

To get going with the Technical Writer AI (TWAI) application.

1. Create a Project and click on your new Project to open it.

1. Create an Operation from the Project page, and click on it to choose your Operation settings.

1. Once you have an Operation, you can specify which source you'd like to use and which actions you'd like to run on that data.

    Some actions have their own settings which allow you to specify your preferences for that action.

1. Remember to save your Operation so you can re-run your selected choices.
