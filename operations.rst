Operations
----------

Operations allow you to add actions and run those actions with particular settings. For example, the settings allow you to run actions against the source data of your choice (e.g, input text or files from a Git repo).

Creating an Operation
=====================

To create a new Operation, navigate to a Project page and click the "Create Operation" button.

The settings within an operation allow you to configure a source and actions to run. The available actions include spell check, word count, grammar check, and Freeform questions.
